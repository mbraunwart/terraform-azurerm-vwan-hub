# Azure Enterprise Virtual WAN Hub Module

This Terraform module provides an enterprise-ready framework for creating and managing Azure Virtual WAN Hubs. It simplifies the deployment of global network infrastructure, enabling secure and scalable connectivity across regions, branch offices, and cloud resources.

## Purpose

The module's primary goal is to streamline the provisioning of Azure Virtual WAN Hub resources while implementing enterprise-grade networking patterns. It reduces complexity in managing global network architectures and provides built-in monitoring and security capabilities.

## Key Capabilities

- **Office 365 Network Optimization**  
  Built-in support for Office 365 traffic categorization and optimization through local breakout configurations.

- **VPN Gateway Integration**  
  Optional VPN Gateway deployment with configurable scale units for branch connectivity.

- **Advanced Routing**  
  Custom route tables and next-hop configurations for precise traffic control.

### Architecture Overview

Virtual WAN Hubs serve as the centerpiece of your global network architecture, providing:
- Centralized connectivity management
- Regional traffic optimization
- Secure branch office connectivity
- Integration with Azure backbone for reliable global routing

### Best Practices

- Plan IP address spaces carefully to avoid overlaps across regions
- Use Standard SKU for production workloads requiring advanced features
- Enable monitoring and flow logs for network visibility
- Configure appropriate retention policies for diagnostic data
- Implement proper tagging for resource organization
- Use branch-to-branch traffic controls based on security requirements

## Known Limitations

- Basic SKU has limited feature availability compared to Standard
- VPN Gateway deployment requires Standard SKU
- Office 365 optimization requires proper category selection
- Resource quotas may limit scalability in some subscriptions

## Usage Example

```hcl
module "virtual_wan_hub" {
  source = "github.com/org/terraform-azurerm-virtual-hub"

  resource_group_name = "rg-vwan-prod"
  location            = "eastus2"

  wan_config = {
    name = "vwan-global"
    type = "Standard"
  }

  hub_config = {
    name                           = "hub-eastus2"
    address_space                  = "10.0.0.0/23"
    sku                           = "Standard"
    routing_preference            = "ExpressRoute"
    allow_branch_to_branch_traffic = true
    disable_vpn_encryption         = false
    office365_category            = "Optimize"
    routes = []
  }

  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
    Department  = "Networking"
  }
}
```
